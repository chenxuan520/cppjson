## Instructions

All code is included in the json.h header file, and all functions can be used by including this header file

## Production Instructions

1. Except for a small part using STL, most of them are made in C

2. The source code is about 1000 lines, including parsing, generating and formatting json data

3. Support the use of // and /**/ as comments

4. Very easy to use. Short hands-on time

5. You can generate json directly like go through {}, which is very convenient

## Instructions

#### Generate json parsing object

```cpp
    //create tree for json text
    Json json(file.getFileBuff(temp));//file.getFileBuff(temp) is const char*
    if(json.lastError()!=NULL)
    {
        printf("%s\n",json.lastError());
        return ;
    }
```

#### Get json data

```cpp
    // find the key value
    if(json["empt"]!=NULL)
        for(unsigned i=0;i<json["empt"]->arr.size();i++)
            printf("%f\n",json["empt"]->arr[i]->floVal);
    if(json["first Name"]!=NULL)
        printf("%s\n",json["first Name"]->strVal.c_str());
```

#### Generate json data

##### General add method

```cpp
    //create a new json text
    char* getStr=json.createObject();
    json.addKeyVal(getStr,Json::STRING,"try","exmaple");
    printf("%s\n",getStr);
    // an others way to add
json.addKeyVal(getStr,"new","string");
json.addKeyVal(getStr,"file name",(const char*)temp);
json.addKeyVal(getStr,"newarr",arr);
```

> When the second method is added, the string needs to be converted to const char*
> 
> It is recommended to use the second method to add

##### Initialize add

```cpp
    //create json in begin
    Json json2={
        {"float",12.3},
        {"int",23},
        {"bool",true},
        {"str","string"},
        {"null",nullptr},
        {"arrFloat",{2.3,8.9,2.3}},
        {"arrBool",{true,false}},
        {"arrStr",{"chenxuan","create"}}
    };
    printf("new create:\n%s\n",json2());
    //after begin you can continue add ketValue
    json2.addKeyVal(json2(),Json::STRING,"temp","chenxuan");
    json2("new arr")=arr;
    printf("new create:\n%s\n",json2());
```

> After the second method is added, get the result through ()
> 
> After the second method, you can still continue to add through the first method
> 
> The second method does not support two-dimensional arrays and object arrays, because the boundaries between arrays and objects will be blurred after high dimensions
> 
> Use the first add if needed

#### format json

```cpp
    const char* result=json.formatPrint(json.getRootObj());
    printf("%s\n",result);//json.getRootObj is get the root of create
```

## Supplementary notes

- Does not support json array types such as [1, "dad", true], because the addition of such arrays is complicated and not used much, ~~too lazy to support~~

- Because it has just been developed, 100% compatibility cannot be guaranteed after subsequent improvements (as compatible as possible)

- Limited technology will inevitably lead to bugs, you can raise issues, and must be carefully revised

## Thanks for the support
